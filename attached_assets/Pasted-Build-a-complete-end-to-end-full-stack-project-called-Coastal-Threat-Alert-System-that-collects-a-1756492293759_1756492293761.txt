Build a complete end-to-end full stack project called ‚ÄúCoastal Threat Alert System‚Äù that collects, analyzes, and visualizes coastal threats (storm surges, cyclones, coastal erosion, pollution, illegal dumping, algal blooms).
The system must combine frontend, backend, AI/ML pipeline, database, APIs, and deployment setup.

üéØ Core Features

Data Ingestion

Collect data from mock sources:

Physical sensors (tide gauges, weather stations).

Satellite data (simulated via APIs).

Historical CSV datasets.

Create an ingestion pipeline (/ingestion service) that streams this data into the database in near-real time.

AI/ML Analysis

Use Python (FastAPI or Flask) for backend ML services.

Models:

Anomaly detection for sudden water-level rise (storm surge).

Trend prediction for sea-level rise using LSTM/ARIMA.

Classification of pollution levels from sensor data.

ML results exposed via REST API or WebSocket (/ml/api).

Backend (Node.js + Express or FastAPI)

REST + WebSocket APIs:

/alerts ‚Üí Get latest alerts.

/reports ‚Üí Submit and view community reports.

/analytics ‚Üí Fetch processed data for charts.

/auth ‚Üí User authentication (JWT-based, roles: Govt, NGO, Fisherfolk).

Alert rules engine: if anomaly ‚Üí trigger notification + insert into DB.

Database

PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

Collections/Tables:

users (id, name, role, contact).

sensors (id, type, location, last_value).

alerts (id, type, severity, timestamp, status).

reports (id, user, type, description, location, media).

historical_data (time-series sensor data).

Frontend (React + TS + Vite + Tailwind)

Dashboard with:

Real-time alerts panel (Framer Motion animations).

Interactive coastal map (React-Leaflet/Mapbox).

Analytics with Recharts/D3.js (tide, wind, pollution trends).

Community reports submission form (with geolocation + media upload).

Role-based views:

Govt: system-wide analytics.

NGOs: pollution + ecosystem health focus.

Fisherfolk: localized alerts & safety tips.

Dark/Light mode toggle with smooth transitions.

Notifications

In-app push notifications.

SMS/Email alerts (Twilio / SendGrid mock integration).

Severity-based notification rules.

Security & Auth

JWT-based authentication.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Secure API endpoints with role filtering.

DevOps & Deployment

Dockerize frontend, backend, ML services, and DB.

Use Docker Compose for local setup.

Deployment-ready on Render/Heroku/Netlify/Vercel.

üì¶ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Recharts + Leaflet.

Backend API: Node.js (Express) OR FastAPI (Python).

ML Models: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB.

Notifications: Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (email), WebSocket (in-app).

DevOps: Docker, Docker Compose, optional CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

üóÇÔ∏è Deliverables

Modular folder structure:

/frontend  ‚Üí React app (dashboard, map, alerts)  
/backend   ‚Üí APIs (alerts, reports, users, analytics)  
/ml        ‚Üí ML models + FastAPI service  
/db        ‚Üí Schema + migrations  
/deploy    ‚Üí Docker + CI/CD configs  


Reusable hooks/components in frontend.

REST + WebSocket APIs with OpenAPI docs.

Pretrained ML models with sample datasets.

Scripts to seed mock sensor data.

End-to-end demo (alerts triggering ‚Üí dashboard update ‚Üí notification).

‚ö° Focus on hackathon-readiness: clean UI/UX, real-time data flow, role-based dashboards, and smooth deployment.
